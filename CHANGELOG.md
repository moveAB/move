In this first release, almost all API routes have been built with partitioning on roles (Admin, Users and Guests). Next features are also built (on API level) : REGISTER, CONFIRM, LOGIN, RESET PASSWORD. All routes are documented through Swagger. There is implemented JWT Authentication. During login, you get session token which is your 'fingerprint' through application flow. There is also a couple of routes and their respected functions in Business logic layer, but they will be finished by the end of project.
